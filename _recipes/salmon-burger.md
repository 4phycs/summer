One important detail to consider when cooking is the amount of flavor you’ll get from a dish in relation to the amount of time you put into it. The best meals are those in which you can minimize effort and maximize deliciousness. Take these tortillas with pulled chicken, for example. Simply pile the ingredients high on a plate, bake them briefly in the oven, and then enjoy a super tasty snack that’s perfect for sharing with friends!
